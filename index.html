                <p>This is a guide for those starting out on their first Physical Therapy internship. This is a guide to help you remember some of the key points during an evaluation. This guide will be a review as well as a way to help you put everything together and keep a framework in your mind when on internship. Good luck!</p>

    <section class='main-section' id='An_Accurate_History'> 
    <header>An Accurate History</header>
      
        <p>Remember the basics when taking the patient’s history.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The timeframe of the injury (acute, subacute, chronic)</li>
                <li>Quality(nerve, muscle, bone, visceral) and Quantity(scale of 1-10) of the pain</li>
                <li>The MOI (Method Of Injury)</li>
                <li>Positions that cause and trigger the pain</li>
                <li>Imaging</li>  
            </ul>
       <p>Family history related questions related to inherited conditions, and any <code>red flags. Red flags</code> will usually include fever, acute inflammation, injuries with no MOI, unexplained weight loss or weight gain, cancer, and any other serious medical conditions. Red flags are important because they determine if you refer the patient to another medical professional or not.  </p></p>

    <section class='main-section' id='Tests_And_Measures' >
    <header>Tests And Measures</header>
        <p>By now you should have a couple of possible diagnoses in mind. The tests and measures will help you determine what the correct diagnosis is.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Movement Analysis</li> 
            <li>Goniometric Measurements</li> 
            <li>MLTs (Manual Length Tests)</li> 
            <li>MMTs (Manual Muscle Tests)</li> 
            <li>Special Tests</li> 
            <li>PFT (Palpation For Tenderness)</li>
            <li>Dermatomes, myotomes, reflexes, and other</li>
            <li>Test Clusters</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Now from your list of findings you should be able to see what findings are normal versus abnormal. Movement analysis, goniometric measurements, and MMTs will tell you whether or not what you are testing is <code><strong>Within Normal Limits</strong></code> or not. Test clusters and special tests will help rule in or rule out specific diagnoses.</p>
      </section>

        <section class='main-section' id='Diagnosing_The_Pathology'> 
        <header>Diagnosing The Pathology</header>
        <p>Diagnosing is an important part of the evaluation, this is where you tie everything together. The information you gathered from the history gives you an idea of what to test. If the patient complains of a pinching feeling when they turn their head to the right, and the onset was due to an awkward sleeping position three weeks ago, with burning sensation, and numbness in their fingers. This should give you a good idea of what tests and measures you want to do.</p>
        <p>You can take range measurements for the neck, shoulder, and elbow <code>MMTs</code> a spurling’s special test, and <code>PFT </code>of the cervical spine and the surrounding structures. This should give you enough information to confirm or reject your diagnosis. However if the findings don’t point to anything to specific then try some more tests.</p>
      </section>

        <section class='main-section' id='Prognosis_And_Outlook'>
        <header>Prognosis And Outlook</header>
        <p>There are a couple of things that factor into the patient’s prognosis and outlook. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The SOC (Stage Of Condition) of the patient</li> 
            <li>The SR (Subject Reactivity)</li> 
            <li>The damaged structure</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>If the SOC is in an acute or sub-acute state the patient will most likely need to rest and to use the <code>PRICE</code> method (Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation). Once they are in the sub-acute to the chronic stage they can begin rehabilitation. If they have been in the chronic stage for a while and are experiencing acute or sub-acute flare-ups and are using the <code>PRICE</code>method, then recovery from the injury will not go as well. </p>
        <p>The SR also factors into the prognosis and outlook, as a patient who has a higher SR will be more likely to protect the injured area then rehabilitate it when they need to. Certain structures will require more time to heal than others. Bone will take approximately 6-8 weeks to heal, while ligament and muscle damage may take a few months to a year to properly heal. Faster recovery is expected if the patient actively follows their treatment plan.</p>
      </section>

        <section class='main-section' id='Treatment_Plan'>
        <header>Treatment Plan</header>
        <p>At the end of the evaluation, you will have to come up with a treatment plan for the patient. Part of that plan should include <code>patient-education</code> on their injury. For example, a patient with cervical radiculopathy should be educated on the anatomical structure of the bones and the nerves of the neck, and where how the compression is affecting them. The other part of the treatment plan should be to treat their deficiencies. If their goni measurements are lower than the norm, then stretching exercises to restore range of motion would be beneficial. If the patient’s MMT’s scores are lower than normal then those should be treated as well. As the patient progresses through their visits their strength should return and the injury should heal. It is however important to keep track of their progress. If your first approach to their condition is not working, then a new approach must be considered at the time of their re-evaluation. </p>
